The demo currently uses data from demo.ghost.org (Thanks for making this available team Ghost ♥️)

## Getting Started

1. Setup ghost. [See how](https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/)
2. Generate an access token. [See how](https://ghost.org/docs/api/v3/admin/#token-authentication)
3. Edit `api/ghost.js` in boo and change line 5 & 6 to match your ghost server configurations
4. You're good to go. Run `npm run dev` and navigate to `http://localhost:6001` to see your site!

## Work in progress

This theme is a side project and will includes lessons I learned while building my own blog with Ghost & NuxtJS.

A lot of the building blocks of this starter theme takes inspiration from the amazing work done by Maxbrain0 on [nuxt-ghost-starter](https://github.com/Maxbrain0/nuxt-ghost-starter)

Turn to the [issues](https://github.com/MrSunshyne/boo/issues) tab to see what's going on with development.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
